### ✨ About Me  
Former café manager turned developer.  
I learned how small changes can completely transform user experiences.  
Seeing seniors struggle with kiosks made me realize  
how important truly **user-friendly interfaces** are.  
Now I design and build digital experiences  
that are both functional and easy to use for everyone.
